# Farewell-Giphy
Collection of gif's from the class as a farewell to Bob
Each of us will be alloted a 'block' on index.html for an image or message to Bob.  Cat giphy's are recommended, but any reference
to songs or movies that he likes would be great too.  You have access to the card.js and an images folder if you need them.  Please
don't edit index.html without talking to me first, as it will be problematic to have too many editors.  Look in card.js for the block
with your name on it, and get creative.
