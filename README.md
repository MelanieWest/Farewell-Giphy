# Farewell-Giphy

I would like us to create together a 'goodbye giphy' for Bob.
I have tried to set it up so it should be a small time investment
for you, and I think together we can make an awesome tribute.

Here is the setup:

1.  The only file I want you to modify is the 'javascript' file with your name on it.  I have created a simple working example of what I hope each of us can do:  find a 'giphy' that you think fits the occasion.  Please copy the code in 'Melanie.js' and rename all the variables using your name, so nothing is overwritten.  You can put your link to your giphy in your js file with this code.  Get as creative as you like with whatever you put into your div.  I reserve the right to 'censor', so keep that in mind.

2. You will link it to the div in 'index.html' with your name on it.

3. I would love ONE creative person to take over the index.html, and ONE other creative person to do something with the CSS.  I know it's a crazy week, so only offer if this would be easy for you.  Just talk to me so I can know who is doing this.
